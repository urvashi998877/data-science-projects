        "Here are the answers to your questions about Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Who developed Python Programming Language?**\n",
        "   - Python was developed by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s and was released in 1991.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Which type of Programming does Python support?**\n",
        "   - Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including **procedural programming**, **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, and **functional programming**.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Is Python case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers?**\n",
        "   - Yes, Python is **case-sensitive**. For example, `Variable` and `variable` would be considered different identifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What is the correct extension of the Python file?**\n",
        "   - The correct extension for a Python file is **.py**.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Is Python code compiled or interpreted?**\n",
        "   - Python code is **interpreted**, meaning it is executed line by line by the Python interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?**\n",
        "   - Some examples of blocks of code in Python are:\n",
        "     - **Functions**: `def function_name():`\n",
        "     - **Loops**: `for`, `while`\n",
        "     - **Conditionals**: `if`, `elif`, `else`\n",
        "     - **Classes**: `class ClassName:`\n",
        "     - **Exception Handling**: `try`, `except`\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?**\n",
        "   - The **hash mark (#)** is used to write single-line comments in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Mention functions which can help us to find the version of Python that we are currently working on?**\n",
        "   - You can use the following functions:\n",
        "     - `sys.version`\n",
        "     - `platform.python_version()`\n",
        "     - `python --version` (command line)\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called?**\n",
        "   - Python supports anonymous functions through the **lambda** keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What does pip stand for in Python?**\n",
        "    - **pip** stands for **Pip Installs Packages**.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Mention a few built-in functions in Python?**\n",
        "    - A few built-in functions in Python are:\n",
        "      - `print()`\n",
        "      - `len()`\n",
        "      - `type()`\n",
        "      - `int()`\n",
        "      - `str()`\n",
        "      - `range()`\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?**\n",
        "    - There is no specific limit to the length of an identifier in Python, but the length should be reasonable for clarity. Technically, the maximum length is constrained by the system's memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **What are the benefits of using Python?**\n",
        "    - Some benefits of Python include:\n",
        "      - Simple and easy-to-read syntax\n",
        "      - Large standard library\n",
        "      - Cross-platform compatibility\n",
        "      - Supports integration with other languages and technologies\n",
        "      - Great community support\n",
        "      - Used for web development, data science, AI, machine learning, automation, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **How is memory managed in Python?**\n",
        "    - Python uses an **automatic garbage collection** mechanism, where memory is allocated and managed by the Python interpreter. Unused objects are removed from memory when they are no longer referenced.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?**\n",
        "    - To install Python on Windows:\n",
        "      1. Download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org).\n",
        "      2. Run the installer and make sure to check the box \"Add Python to PATH\" before clicking Install.\n",
        "      3. You can also manually add Python to the PATH by modifying the system's environment variables to include the directory where Python is installed.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **Is indentation required in Python?**\n",
        "    - Yes, **indentation** is required in Python. It is used to define code blocks and structure the program. For example, the body of loops, conditionals, functions, etc., is defined through indentation instead of curly braces.\n",
        "\n",
