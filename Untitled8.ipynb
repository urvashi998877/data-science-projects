        "### Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of data.\n",
        "   - **Example**: By using private or protected access modifiers, we hide the internal state of an object and provide controlled access through public methods (getters and setters).\n",
        "   - **Benefit**: Helps in data hiding, improves modularity, and protects object integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features or functionalities. It allows the user to interact with the object at a higher level without needing to understand the underlying complexity.\n",
        "   - **Example**: A car has a \"drive\" method that abstracts away the internal complexities of how the car moves (e.g., engine functions, transmission system). The user just needs to press the accelerator to drive.\n",
        "   - **Benefit**: Helps reduce complexity and allows focusing on high-level operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: Inheritance is the mechanism in OOP that allows a new class (child class) to acquire the properties and behaviors (methods) of an existing class (parent class). The child class can also extend or override methods to customize functionality.\n",
        "   - **Example**: A class `Car` may inherit from a class `Vehicle`. The `Car` class will inherit properties like `speed` and `fuel_capacity` and can have additional attributes like `model` and `year`.\n",
        "   - **Benefit**: Promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between parent and child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also allows methods to have the same name but behave differently based on the object calling them.\n",
        "   - **Example**: A method `make_sound()` can be defined in a superclass `Animal`. However, subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat` can implement their own versions of `make_sound()`, making the method behave differently for different objects (e.g., a dog barks, and a cat meows).\n",
        "   - **Benefit**: Provides flexibility and allows methods to be used interchangeably across different types.\n",
